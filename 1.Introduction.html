      <!-- Paragraph describing the NSW education system -->
      <p><!--start of the paragraph-->
        The New South Wales (NSW) education system helps children learn and grow from their early years until the end of high school. 
        Most kids go to public schools, which are free and run by the government. There are also private schools and Catholic schools. 
        Teachers follow a set plan called a curriculum, which covers reading, writing, math, and other subjects. 
        Schools also focus on helping kids feel safe and happy. Children and young people are at the centre of all their decision-making. 
        The government ensure that young children get the best start in life by supporting and regulating the early childhood education and care sector. 
        They are the largest provider of public education in Australia with responsibility for delivering high-quality public education to two-thirds of the NSW student population. 
        They respect and value Aboriginal people as Australia's First Nation Peoples. 
        They also work closely with the non-government school and higher education sectors.

        They also follow the NESA curriculum. This is a most standard curriculum in the world. 
        NESA continues to work closely with teachers and the school sectors to ensure that new Kâ€“12 NSW syllabus structure and content are based on evidence of what we know works best, 
        and reflects feedback from teachers, stakeholders and industry professionals. 
        The main goal is to get students ready for life after school. 
        The government makes rules for how schools work and gives them money to run. 
        They are working on fixing problems like not having enough teachers or needing better school buildings. 
        Overall, the NSW education system wants every student to have a fair chance to learn well.
