      In New South Wales (NSW), primary school includes special academic pathways for high-achieving students through Opportunity Classes (OC) and Selective High Schools. These exams are among the most challenging in NSW and help improve students' educational skills. One of the best selective schools in NSW is Baulkham Hills High School, ranked among the top 5.

      Opportunity Classes are designed for gifted and high-potential students in Years 5 and 6. These classes offer a more challenging curriculum and are available in selected public primary schools across NSW. Students typically apply in Year 3 or early Year 4, and if accepted, transfer to a school with an OC program for Years 5 and 6. There are currently 89 opportunity classes, including full-time programs and online options through Aurora College for rural students.

      <p><!--start of the selective school paragraph-->
      Selective High Schools cater to academically gifted students from Year 7 to Year 12. Entry is based on a competitive placement test taken in Year 5 or 6. These schools are not zoned, meaning students can apply regardless of where they live. Many families choose selective schools to support academic success in higher secondary education.
