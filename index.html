         My website is about NSW education system. This will be an overview of it. Many people from overseas are coming to Australia for education. But New South Wales’s Education system is completely different from other countries and other states of Australia’s education system. This difference can be hard for the students. In my website, there will be information about New South Wales’s education system: OC exam, selective exam, Naplan and HSC. There are websites about it, but many of them are not true and they are not descriptive. My website will be factual because I have gone through many of them in my life.
